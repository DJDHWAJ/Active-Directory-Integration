# Active Directory Integration Tool

## **Objective**
This project integrates with **Active Directory (AD)** to handle **user authentication, user management, and security monitoring**. It allows system administrators to interact with AD using **Python (LDAP)** and a **GUI interface**.

## **What is Active Directory?**
**Active Directory (AD)** is a Microsoft service that **manages users, groups, policies, and security access** in enterprise environments. Organizations use AD for **centralized authentication and authorization**.

## **Project Outcome**
By using this AD integration tool, system administrators can:
**Authenticate users via Active Directory (LDAP)**  
**List, modify, and reset user passwords**  
**Monitor authentication attempts and failures**  
**Generate reports for auditing purposes**  

## **Features**
- **User Authentication via AD (LDAP)**
- **GUI-based user authentication system**
- **Modify user attributes (reset passwords, disable accounts)**
- **Logging for security and auditing**
- **Export user reports in JSON format**

## **Installation**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
